# Symptoms

Linux 4.4.0-22-generic on ***Ubuntu 16.04 LTS*** seems a little bit
unresponsive from time to time when copying large files e.g to a USB pen drive.
In my experience, even the Unity clock can freeze for a couple of seconds
during the operation. I didn't experience the previous with older Ubuntu LTS
releases.

# Fix

This [blog](https://lonesysadmin.net/2013/12/22/better-linux-disk-caching-performance-vm-dirty_ratio/) makes a good job in explaining all the details. However,
I jump directly to my modifications.

Append the following to ***/etc/sysctl.conf*** (root permissions required):

```
# Limit the buffer size for asynchronous operations
vm.dirty_background_bytes = 16777216
vm.dirty_bytes = 50331648
# Avoid swapping unless absolutely necessary
vm.swappiness = 0
```

You can enforce the new sysctl settings without rebooting:

```
sudo sysctl -p
```
